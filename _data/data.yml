            I am a part of autonomous senior specialists team. We deliver complex projects on time and budget, effectively managing 
            and addressing customer challenges.

            Main projects: 
            - Social media communication control platform

              Product allows managing content and user engagement on major social medias from one place.
              Main responsibility is keeping system stable and implementing high-level customer requirements. 
              My work involved analysing and adapting frequent changes in social media APIs, ensuring platform remained up-to-date and secure. 
              I have implemented crucial authentication and security fixes with IdenityServer and OAuth2.
              One of the main challenges was maintaining sophisticated frontend solution with two frameworks Angular.Js and React.
              
            - Construction Equipment Management System

              Developed and architected new solution for replacing old legacy system. I was focused on building frontend applicaton using
              Angular and PrimeNg to ensure that interface is user-friendly and efficient for field workers working on mobile apps and tablets.
              I have also developed a prototype for data synchronization through ODBC to sunset legacy system and switch users to new one.

            - International Logistics Project

              Developed and maintained application for order, fleet management as well as route and pricing calculation. Developed three React Native mobile applications
              based on Expo SDK for different roles in logistics chain. I worked closely with stakeholders to gather requirements and manage the project growth. 
              I was also responsible for architecture and development of web app which incorporated all needed features for logistics management, ensuring system is
              user friendly and performant. 

              Technologies used: **ASP.NET, Angular, React, PrimeNg, EntityFramework, MS SQL Server, Redux, MobX, MUI, React Native, Expo SDK, Terraform, Azure**

      - role: Software Developer
        time: 01.2017 - 08.2022
        duration: 5 years 8 months
        company: If P&C Insurance, Riga, Latvia
        details: |
          - Developed new generation claim handling system as a part of 
            cross-functional team. The product allowed claim handlers to spend less time on operational tasks
            and focus on important cases as process was fully automated. In case of anomaly claims handler
            could dig in, resolve the problem and resume automated handling.
            Project was broken into loosely coupled event-based services which allowed rapid deployment and scaling
            as project grew. I also have developed fraud detection system as a part of claims handling flow.
          
            Technologies used: **ASP.NET, React, Typescript, Javascript, EntityFramework, MSSQL, Elasticsearch, GraphQL, RabbitMQ, MassTransit**

          - Together with small cross-functional team I have developed claims submission platform for clients across Baltics. Instead of classic form submission
            we have developed conversation-styled flow which was much more user-friendly and less overwhelming for the users to fill. We have tried 
            to make the product and user-experience as welcoming as possible because in case of high-stress or frustrating situations users can make mistakes
            while filling the claim request. We constantly monitored user behaviour using Google Analytics, logs in Kibana and collected user feedback which allowed us
            rapidly adjust and improve the system. After thousands of applications users have rated their experience 4.8/5.

            System was integrated with the old claims handling system which later will be replaced by new generation claim handling system as my next project.

            Technologies used: **ASP.NET, Angular, Typescript, Javascript, Microsoft ServiceFabric, Dapper, OAuth2 & OIDC, MassTransit, RabbitMQ**

          Other technologies used: **Microsoft Azure, Azure DevOps, Octopus Deploy, Terraform, JetBrains TeamCity**

          - During various periods I have participated in different smaller scaler projects like client registry, address search registry, email encryption service, 
          large scale system maintenance.
